**Version 1.0.3 - January 27, 2026 - FHIR R4 Validation and UUID Corrections**

Changes to both supplier-api-spec.yaml and home-test-supplier-api.yaml:

16. Fixed UUID Validation Issues in Observation Resources
- **supplier-api-spec.yaml**: Changed FHIRObservation.id example from "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" to "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
  - Reason: Observation ID conflicted with ServiceRequest ID causing reference validation errors
  - Ensures unique UUIDs across all resources to prevent FHIR reference mismatches
- **home-test-supplier-api.yaml**: Observation.id example already correctly set to "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
- **supplier-api-spec.yaml**: Updated FHIRBundleSearchsetObservations.entry.fullUrl example to "urn:uuid:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
  - Ensures Bundle fullUrl matches the Observation resource ID
  - Critical for FHIR Bundle validation where fullUrl must reference the correct resource


---

**Version 1.0.4 - January 27, 2026 - Business-Critical Required Fields (FHIR Profiling)**

Changes to both supplier-api-spec.yaml and home-test-supplier-api.yaml:
Added Required Fields for Business Operations (FHIR Constrained Profile)

18. FHIRServiceRequest Required Fields Added (supplier-api-spec.yaml only)
- Made `contained` required (minItems: 1) - Patient demographics are mandatory for order fulfillment
- Made contained Patient properties required:
  - `resourceType` - Required for FHIR resource type identification
  - `id` - Required for contained resource reference (#patient-1)
  - `name` - Required (patient identification for order processing)
  - `telecom` - Required (contact information for delivery and follow-up)
  - `address` - Required (shipping address for test kit delivery)

19. FHIRObservation Required Fields Added (both APIs)
- Made `basedOn` required - Links Observation to originating ServiceRequest (critical for order tracking)
- Made `valueCodeableConcept` required - The actual test result must be present (core purpose of Observation)

20. FHIRTask Required Fields Added (home-test-supplier-api.yaml only)
- Made `identifier` required - Essential for tracking order status across systems

24. FHIR Datatype Required Fields Added (supplier-api-spec.yaml only)
- FHIRHumanName: Made `family` required - Last name is mandatory for patient identification
- FHIRContactPoint: Made `value` required - Contact method is useless without actual contact value
- FHIRAddress: Made `line` and `postalCode` required - Minimum address information for UK deliveries

25. Patient Telecom Cardinality Constraint Added (supplier-api-spec.yaml only)
- Made Patient.telecom `minItems: 2` - Requires at least 2 contact points
- Updated description to clarify both phone and email are required
- **Business Rationale**: Both phone (for delivery contact) and email are essential for order fulfillment and customer communication
- **Implementation Note**: Application validation should verify one telecom has `system: 'phone'` and one has `system: 'email'`
